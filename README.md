This project was created for an academic assignment as part of my web development coursework. It represents many hours of work, dedication, and learning. Throughout the project, I practiced essential front-end development skills including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also used Git for version control and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my main development environment.
