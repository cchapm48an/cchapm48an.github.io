This project was created for an academic assignment as part of my web development coursework. It represents many hours of work, dedication, and learning. Throughout the project, I practiced essential front-end development skills including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and CSV data handling, while also using Git version control and Visual Studio Code as my main development environment.

🔧 Technologies and Tools Used
HTML5 was used to structure the content of the website.
CSS3 was used to style the layout and apply design principles.
JavaScript was used to add interactivity and dynamic features.
CSV files were included for data usage when needed.
Git and GitHub were used for version control and deployment through GitHub Pages.
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) served as the main code editor for building and testing the project.

🎯 Project Purpose
The purpose of this project was to apply CRAP design principles (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity), build a clean and functioning webpage, organize files properly, and practice debugging and validation. This project also helped me learn how to deploy a website through GitHub Pages and how to effectively use VS Code tools and extensions.

📂 Features
The project includes a responsive webpage layout, clear navigation, consistent styling, interactive functionality through JavaScript, and optional integration of CSV data. The folder structure is clean and organized for easier maintenance.

📚 Lessons Learned
During this project, I learned how to organize and manage a multi-file web project. I improved my workflow using VS Code, practiced Git commands such as committing and pushing updates, and learned how to publish a working website on GitHub Pages. I also gained a stronger understanding of clean coding practices and design consistency.
