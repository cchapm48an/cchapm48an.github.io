                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong>  Low contrast between background colors and shopping elements makes it difficult to distinguish sections, with bright visuals straining the eyes.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Inconsistent font styling and varying text sizes make some content hard to read and visually unappealing..</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Product listings are aligned, but the cluttered layout makes it difficult to focus on individual items.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong>  Overloaded interface with too many items closely packed together, making navigation difficult and overwhelming to browse.</li>
